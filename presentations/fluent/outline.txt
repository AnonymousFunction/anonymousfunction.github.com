* Zelda Outline Notes *

Brief intro about me

Plug the AirPair article and other Canvas demos I've done

Quick look at canvas element and how the coordinates work

Talk about background and how it has no real effect on the game
 - Hide the background in Dev Tools and go into the shop

Talk about requestAnimationFrame

Talk about the collection of game bodies
 - Each body has an update function and draw function
 - For each run of requestAnimationFrame we update each bodies state and draw it

Talk about Link's sprites
 - The image drawn doesn't actually effect the game
 - The image drawn is base on the body's state
 - The image is drawn at the center of the body
 - Change link's spriteCooldown to 2 (running on ice) and 24 (long glide)
 - Change link's moveRate to 4.0 to show him moving fast

Talk about controls
 - Loop is listening to keyboard, controller and touch devices
 - Moves by velocity if direction is pressed, if link can move there

Talk about environmental collision detection
 - This is where Link can and cannot move, trigger caves & dungeons
 - Show movement map
 - Show map editor (hotkey 'M'), and buildMap() in the console
 - Turn on link's hit boxes to show collision detection

Talk about item/enemy collision detection
 - For each loop, check if link is colliding with any items/enemies
 - Do any enemies need to take damage?

Screen transitions
 - Enemies and items are despawned when leaving
 - Enemies are drawn when arriving

Caves
 - Show cave properties for what's in them and the text that is drawn

Game Genie
 - Increase link's speed
 - Turn off collision, go to first dungeon
 - Turn on invincibility, walk thru enemies
 - Give link sword, then show first cave is empty
 - Give link lots of rupees, go buy blue candle
