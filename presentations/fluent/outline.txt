* Zelda Outline Notes *

THE LEGEND OF CANVAS

ABOUT ME
- Brief intro about me and the project

HEY! LISTEN!
- Show people where the slides are
- Link to the game, code, and AirPair article

INVENTORY
- Basic elements of game design

BASIC CANVAS
- Quick look at canvas element
- Show that there are canvases for the menu, game, and controller

DRAWING TO CANVAS
- Explain how the coordinates work

MAP BACKGROUND
- Go to the shop with the background on
- CODE DEMO: Hide the background in Dev Tools and go into the shop again

GAME LOOP
- Talk about requestAnimationFrame
- Show JSFiddle example, browser tries to maintain 60fps

GAME BODIES (Old Man example)
- Show how each game body has an update and draw function

GAME BODIES (Sword cave example)
- Talk about the collection of game bodies
- For each run of requestAnimationFrame we update each bodies state and draw it

SPRITES
 - The image is base on the body's state
 - The image is drawn at the center of the body
 - The image doesn't actually effect the game
 - CODE DEMO: Change link's spriteCooldown to 2 (running on ice) and 24 (long glide)
 - CODE DEMO: Change link's moveRate to 4.0 to show him moving fast
 - CODE DEMO: Show link walking backwards

COLLISION DETECTION (Environmental)
 - This is where Link can and cannot move, trigger caves & dungeons
 - Show movement map
 - Show map editor (hotkey 'M'), and buildMap() in the console
 - DEMO: Turn on link's hit boxes to show collision detection (zelda.js find 'center dot')

COLLISION DETECTION (Items/Enemies)
 - For each loop, check if link is colliding with any items/enemies
 - Do any enemies need to take damage?

GAME GENIE
 - DEMO: Turn off collision, go to first dungeon
 - DEMO: Turn on invincibility, Spawn lots of octoroks
 - DEMO: Give link sword, then show first cave is empty
 - DEMO: Give link lots of rupees, go buy blue candle

EXTRA TIME

Talk about controls
 - Loop is listening to keyboard, controller and touch devices
 - Moves by velocity if direction is pressed, if link can move there

Screen transitions
 - Enemies and items are despawned when leaving
 - Enemies are drawn when arriving

Caves
 - Show cave properties for what's in them and the text that is drawn
